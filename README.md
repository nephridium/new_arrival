## New Arrival

An app to track a newborn's developmental milestones written with Polymer 1.0 (based on the [Polymer Starter Kit](https://github.com/polymerelements/polymer-starter-kit)).

Simply enter a date of birth and gender of a newborn and the app will calculate its estimated weight/height and display milestones that are due or coming up (such as crawling, talking Gibberish etc.)
